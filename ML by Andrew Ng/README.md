# This is a repository of my Machine Learning course by Stanford University on Coursera

## Summary

In this course, I learnt machine learning techniques and practiced implementing them.

Topics learnt:

1. **Supervised learning** (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).
2. **Unsupervised learning** (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning).
3. **Best practices in machine learning** (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).

Practiced applications on:

1. **Smart robots** (perception, control)
2. **Text understanding** (web search, anti-spam)
3. **Computer vision**
4. Medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
